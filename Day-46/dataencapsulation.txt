Data encapsulation in JavaScript refers to the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit or object, while restricting access to some of the object's components. This helps to protect the internal state of the object and maintain its integrity.
Key Concepts of Data Encapsulation

    Private Variables: You can create variables that are not accessible from outside the object.
    Public Methods: You can expose methods that allow controlled access to the private data.
    Closure: JavaScript closures are often used to create private variables.



Explanation of the Example

    Private Variable: The balance variable is defined within the BankAccount function and is not accessible from outside the function.
    Public Methods: The methods deposit, withdraw, and getBalance provide controlled access to the balance.
    Closure: Each of the public methods forms a closure that captures the balance variable, allowing these methods to manipulate it while keeping it private.

Benefits of Data Encapsulation

    Data Integrity: Prevents external code from directly modifying internal state.
    Improved Maintainability: Changes to internal implementation can be made without affecting external code that uses the object.
    Code Organization: Grouping related data and functions together makes the code easier to understand and manage.

Data encapsulation is a powerful concept that enhances the robustness and clarity of your JavaScript code!

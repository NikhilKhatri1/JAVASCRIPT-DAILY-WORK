        In JavaScript, a class is a template for creating objects with shared properties and methods. It is a special type of
        function, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), that allows for easier and cleaner object-oriented programming (OOP).
        
        Here are some examples of how to define and use classes in JavaScript:
        1. Basic Class Definition
        
        A basic class in JavaScript can be defined using the class keyword, followed by a constructor method for initializing
        the object and other methods for behavior.
        Example:
        
        // Define a Car class
        class Car {
        constructor(make, model, year) {
        this.make = make; // Initialize the make of the car
        this.model = model; // Initialize the model of the car
        this.year = year; // Initialize the year of the car
        }
        
        // Method to start the engine
        startEngine() {
        console.log(`The ${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}'s engine is now running.`);
        }
        
        // Method to stop the engine
        stopEngine() {
        console.log(`The ${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}'s engine is now off.`);
        }
        }
        
        // Create an instance of the Car class
        const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2023);
        
        // Use the class methods
        myCar.startEngine(); // The 2023 Toyota Corolla's engine is now running.
        myCar.stopEngine(); // The 2023 Toyota Corolla's engine is now off.
        
        2. Class Inheritance
        
        JavaScript classes also support inheritance, allowing one class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another
        class (parent).
        Example:
        
        // Define a base class Vehicle
        class Vehicle {
        constructor(make, model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        }
        
        displayInfo() {
        console.log(`${this.make} ${this.model}`);
        }
        }
        
        // Define a subclass Car that extends Vehicle
        class Car extends Vehicle {
        constructor(make, model, year) {
        super(make, model); // Call the parent class constructor
        this.year = year;
        }
        
        displayCarInfo() {
        console.log(`${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
        }
        }
        
        // Create an instance of Car
        const myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022);
        
        // Call methods from both the parent and the child class
        myCar.displayInfo(); // Honda Civic
        myCar.displayCarInfo(); // 2022 Honda Civic
        
        In the example above, Car inherits from Vehicle. The super() function is used to call the parent class constructor.
        3. Getters and Setters
        
        JavaScript classes can also have getter and setter methods that allow you to access and modify an object's properties in
        a controlled way.
        Example:
        
        class Rectangle {
        constructor(width, height) {
        this._width = width; // Private property with an underscore convention
        this._height = height;
        }
        
        // Getter for width
        get width() {
        return this._width;
        }
        
        // Setter for width
        set width(value) {
        if (value > 0) {
        this._width = value;
        } else {
        console.log("Width must be positive!");
        }
        }
        
        // Getter for height
        get height() {
        return this._height;
        }
        
        // Setter for height
        set height(value) {
        if (value > 0) {
        this._height = value;
        } else {
        console.log("Height must be positive!");
        }
        }
        
        // Method to calculate area
        calculateArea() {
        return this._width * this._height;
        }
        }
        
        // Create a new Rectangle instance
        const rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
        
        console.log(rect.calculateArea()); // 50
        
        // Modify properties using setters
        rect.width = 20;
        rect.height = 15;
        
        console.log(rect.calculateArea()); // 300
        
        In this example, we define width and height as private properties with the _ prefix and use getter and setter methods to
        safely access and modify them.
        4. Static Methods
        
        Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. They are called on
        the class directly, not on an instance.
        Example:
        
        class MathUtils {
        // Static method to calculate the square of a number
        static square(num) {
        return num * num;
        }
        
        // Static method to calculate the cube of a number
        static cube(num) {
        return num * num * num;
        }
        }
        
        // Call static methods without creating an instance
        console.log(MathUtils.square(4)); // 16
        console.log(MathUtils.cube(3)); // 27
        
        Here, the square and cube methods are static, so they can be called directly on the MathUtils class.
        5. Private Fields and Methods (ES2022+)
        
        JavaScript now supports private fields and methods, denoted by a # prefix, making it possible to truly encapsulate data
        within a class.
        Example:
        
        class BankAccount {
        // Private field for balance
        #balance = 0;
        
        constructor(accountNumber) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        }
        
        // Public method to deposit money
        deposit(amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
        this.#balance += amount;
        console.log(`Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${this.#balance}`);
        } else {
        console.log("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
        }
        
        // Public method to get the balance
        getBalance() {
        return this.#balance;
        }
        }
        
        // Create an instance of BankAccount
        const myAccount = new BankAccount("123456789");
        
        // Access private field through public methods
        myAccount.deposit(1000); // Deposited 1000. New balance: 1000
        console.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // 1000
        
        // Uncommenting the following line will throw an error because #balance is private
        // console.log(myAccount.#balance); // SyntaxError: Private field '#balance' must be declared in an enclosing class
        
        In this example, the #balance field is private and cannot be accessed directly outside the class. The only way to
        interact with it is through public methods.
        Summary of Key Concepts:
        
        Classes in JavaScript provide a clear syntax for creating objects.
        Inheritance allows you to extend classes and reuse code.
        Getters and Setters enable controlled access to object properties.
        Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances.
        Private fields are variables that can only be accessed within the class.
        
        These features make JavaScript's class system powerful and flexible for object-oriented design.

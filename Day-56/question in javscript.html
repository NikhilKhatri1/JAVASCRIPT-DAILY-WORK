<p>Interview Answer

    If an interviewer asks about hoisting, a good explanation might be:

    "Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing
    scope during the compile phase. This means you can reference variables or call functions before they appear in the
    code.
    However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or assignments. For variables declared with var,
    this can lead to unexpected results, like accessing a variable before it’s assigned a value, which will return
    undefined. With function declarations, the entire function is hoisted, so you can call it before it’s defined in the
    code."</p>

<script>
    age1 = 100;
    console.log(age1);  // reference error: let and const are not hoisted
    let age1 = 20;
</script>

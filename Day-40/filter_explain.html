            Explanation
            
            $(function () { ... });
            This is shorthand for $(document).ready(function() { ... });.
            It ensures that the code inside it runs only after the DOM is fully loaded. This is important for ensuring that jQuery
            can find and manipulate the HTML elements correctly.
            
            $("#input").on("keyup", function () { ... });
            This attaches an event handler to the HTML element with the ID input (typically an input field).
            The event handler listens for the keyup event, which occurs every time the user releases a key while the input field is
            focused.
            When the keyup event is triggered, the function inside it is executed.
            
            var value = $(this).val().toLowerCase();
            $(this) refers to the HTML element that triggered the event, which in this case is the #input field.
            .val() gets the current value of the input field.
            .toLowerCase() converts this value to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive search.
            value now holds the lowercase text that the user has entered into the input field.
            
            $("#myTable tr").filter(function () { ... });
            $("#myTable tr") selects all <tr> elements (table rows) within the table with the ID myTable.
                .filter(function () { ... }); filters these selected rows based on a condition provided in the function.
            
                $(this).toggle($(this).text().toLowerCase().indexOf(value) > -1)
                $(this) within the filter function refers to the current row (
            <tr>) being processed.
                .text() gets the text content of the current row.
                .toLowerCase() converts this text to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
                .indexOf(value) checks if the lowercase value is found within the lowercase text of the row. If value is found,
                indexOf returns a position index (which is >= 0); otherwise, it returns -1.
                > -1 checks if indexOf returned a position index, meaning value was found in the row text.
                .toggle() shows the row if the condition is true (meaning the row contains the search term) or hides it if false.
            
                Summary
            
                This script creates a dynamic search filter for a table:
            
                When the user types into an input field (#input), the script captures each keystroke (keyup event).
                It then compares the entered text (converted to lowercase) with the text in each row of the table (#myTable tr).
                Rows containing the search term are shown, while those that donâ€™t match are hidden.
            
                This provides a live search functionality, allowing users to filter table rows as they type into the search field.

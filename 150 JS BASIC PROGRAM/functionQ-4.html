<!-- 5. Write a JavaScript program to compute the exponent of a number.
Note : The exponent of a number says how many times the base number is used as a factor.
82 = 8 x 8 = 64. Here 8 is the base and 2 is the exponent. -->

    function Power(num, pow) {
        if (pow === 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return num * Power(num, pow - 1);
    }
    document.write(Power(8, 2));

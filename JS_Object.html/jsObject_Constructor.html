    <h1>The constructor property returns the function that created the Object prototype.</h1>
    <h3>The constructor property in JavaScript helps identify which function was used to create an object. For objects created
    with literal syntax ({}) or new Object(), constructor typically points to Object because these objects inherit from
    Object.prototype. Understanding this property is crucial when working with inheritance and prototypes in JavaScript, as
    it helps determine the origin of objects and their methods.</h3>

        Certainly! Let's illustrate the difference between function declaration and function expression with a few examples in
        JavaScript.
        Function Declaration
        
        Function declarations are defined using the function keyword. They are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning you
        can call the function before it's declared in your code.
        
        Example:
        
        javascript
        
        PrintMessage(); // You can call it before declaration
        
        function PrintMessage() {
        console.log("Hello, this is a function declaration.");
        }
        
        In this example, PrintMessage is declared using the function declaration syntax. It can be called anywhere within the
        same scope, even before its actual declaration due to hoisting.
        Function Expression
        
        Function expressions involve assigning a function to a variable. They are not hoisted like function declarations, so
        they cannot be called before the variable assignment.
        
        Example:
        
        javascript
        
        Print(); // This would throw an error: Uncaught TypeError: Print is not a function
        
        var Print = function() {
        console.log("Hello, this is a function expression.");
        };
        
        In this example, Print is assigned an anonymous function using a function expression. If you try to call Print() before
        the assignment (var Print = ...), it will result in an error because Print is not yet defined as a function.
        Illustrating the Difference
        
        Let's modify your original example to showcase both function declaration and function expression:
        
        javascript
        
        // Function Declaration
        function greet() {
        return "Hello, welcome!";
        }
        
        // Function Expression
        var sayGoodbye = function() {
        return "Goodbye, see you soon!";
        };
        
        var time = new Date().getHours();
        var result;
        
        if (time < 12) { result=greet(); } else { result=sayGoodbye(); } console.log(result); Explanation: Function Declaration
            (greet): greet() is declared using the function declaration syntax. It is hoisted to the top of its scope, so you
            can call it anywhere within the same scope. Function Expression (sayGoodbye): sayGoodbye is assigned an anonymous
            function using a function expression. It is not hoisted, so you must define it before you call it. Usage: Depending
            on the time variable (current hour), either greet() or sayGoodbye() is called and assigned to result, which is then
            printed to the console. Conclusion Function Declaration (function greet() { ... }): Used when you want to define a
            named function that can be called before its declaration due to hoisting. Function Expression (var
            sayGoodbye=function() { ... };): Used when you want to assign a function to a variable, often for cases where you
            need to define functions dynamically or conditionally. These examples demonstrate the practical differences between
            function declaration and function expression in JavaScript. understood <script>
            function greet(name) {
            var hours = new Date().getHours();
            if (hours < 12) { document.write(Good Morning ${name}); } else { document.write(Good Afternoon ${name}); } }
                greet("Emma"); </script>
                this function declaration but doing tha same work and expresion then whts the meaning of using expression

                In JavaScript, both function declarations and function expressions serve similar purposesâ€”they define functions
                that can be executed later in the code. However, there are subtle differences in how they are used and where
                they are advantageous.
                Function Declaration vs Function Expression
        
                Let's rewrite your example using a function expression instead of a function declaration:
                Function Declaration (Original)
        
                javascript
        
                <script>
                    function greet(name) {
                        var hours = new Date().getHours();
                        if (hours < 12) {
                            document.write(`Good Morning ${name}`);
                        }
                        else {
                            document.write(`Good Afternoon ${name}`);
                        }
                    }
                    greet("Emma");
                </script>
        
                Function Expression (Equivalent)
        
                javascript
        
                <script>
                    var greet = function (name) {
                        var hours = new Date().getHours();
                        if (hours < 12) {
                            document.write(`Good Morning ${name}`);
                        }
                        else {
                            document.write(`Good Afternoon ${name}`);
                        }
                    };
                    greet("Emma");
                </script>
        
                Meaning of Using Function Expression
        
                1. Anonymous Functions:
        
                Function expressions allow you to create anonymous functions (functions without a name), which can be useful in
                situations where the function is used only once or where you want to assign different functions dynamically
                based on conditions.
        
                2. Dynamic Function Assignment:
        
                You can conditionally assign different functions to variables based on runtime conditions, which can't be easily
                achieved with function declarations.
        
                Example:
        
                javascript
        
                <script>
                    var greet;

                    if (new Date().getHours() < 12) {
                        greet = function (name) {
                            document.write(`Good Morning ${name}`);
                        };
                    } else {
                        greet = function (name) {
                            document.write(`Good Afternoon ${name}`);
                        };
                    }

                    greet("Emma");
                </script>
        
                In this example using function expressions:
        
                Depending on the current time, the greet variable is assigned a different function. This allows for dynamic
                behavior based on conditions that wouldn't be straightforward with function declarations.
        
                3. Function Scope and Hoisting:
        
                Function expressions are not hoisted like function declarations. They are only accessible after the assignment
                statement has been executed. This can be advantageous for controlling the order of execution and managing scope.
        
                When to Use Function Expressions
        
                Dynamic Functionality: When you need to assign different functions dynamically based on conditions or variables.
                Scope Control: When you want to control the visibility and availability of functions within specific scopes.
                Encapsulation: When you want to encapsulate functions within variables to avoid polluting the global namespace.
        
                Conclusion
        
                While function declarations and function expressions both define functions, function expressions provide more
                flexibility in certain scenarios, such as dynamic function assignment and scope management. Understanding when
                to use each type helps in writing more efficient and maintainable JavaScript code.

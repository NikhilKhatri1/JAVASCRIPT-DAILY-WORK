<!-- Async and Await

async and await are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, providing a way to write asynchronous code
that looks synchronous. -->

<script>
    async function fetchData() {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    }

    fetchData();

</script>

        <pre>Simple Explanation
    
    Class: Think of a class as a recipe or blueprint. It defines how an object should look and behave.
    Data and Logic: Classes store data (like name or price) and contain functions (like calculateTotal() or validateEmail())
    to work with that data.
    Model vs. Entity:
    Model is about managing data (like storing customer information).
    Entity is about business rules (like handling orders or managing inventory).
    Blueprint: A class lets you create many objects that all follow the same design, but each instance can hold different
    data.
    
    In essence, JavaScript classes help you organize your code by defining reusable patterns for creating objects with
    specific data and behaviors, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

            Accessors (Getter and Setter):
            
            Getter: Retrieves the value of a property.
            Setter: Sets the value of a property.
            
            javascript
            
            class Product {
            constructor(name, price) {
            this._name = name; // Private property convention
            this._price = price;
            }
            
            get name() {
            return this._name;
            }
            
            set name(newName) {
            if (typeof newName === 'string') {
            this._name = newName;
            } else {
            console.error('Name should be a string');
            }
            }
            }
            
            let product1 = new Product("Tablet", 500);
            console.log(product1.name); // Output: Tablet
            
            product1.name = "New Tablet";
            console.log(product1.name); // Output: New Tablet
            
            Functions in Classes:
            
            Method: A function defined within a class.
            
            javascript
            
            class Product {
            constructor(name, price) {
            this.name = name;
            this.price = price;
            }
            
            calculateDiscount(percent) {
            return this.price * (1 - percent / 100);
            }
            }
            
            let product1 = new Product("Camera", 300);
            console.log(product1.calculateDiscount(10)); // Output: 270 (discounted price)
            
            Explanation in Simple Terms:
            
            Class Declaration: Defines a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.
            
            Property: Stores data related to each object created from the class.
            
            Accessors: Provide controlled access to class properties.
            Getter: Retrieves property values.
            Setter: Sets property values, with optional validation or logic.
            
            Functions in Classes (Methods): Perform actions or calculations related to the class's purpose.
            
            In essence, classes in JavaScript are like blueprints for creating objects that encapsulate both data (properties) and
            behavior (methods). They allow you to create reusable code structures, making it easier to manage and organize your
            application's logic.

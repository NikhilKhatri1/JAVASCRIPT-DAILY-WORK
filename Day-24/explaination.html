        <pre>Simple Explanation
    
    Class: Think of a class as a recipe or blueprint. It defines how an object should look and behave.
    Data and Logic: Classes store data (like name or price) and contain functions (like calculateTotal() or validateEmail())
    to work with that data.
    Model vs. Entity:
    Model is about managing data (like storing customer information).
    Entity is about business rules (like handling orders or managing inventory).
    Blueprint: A class lets you create many objects that all follow the same design, but each instance can hold different
    data.
    
    In essence, JavaScript classes help you organize your code by defining reusable patterns for creating objects with
    specific data and behaviors, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
